# RememberingStyleSwitcher
A very simple project that remembers when the style of the page is changed.
 This is a very simple page that stores the colors style picked in localstorage,
 even if you refresh the page the style is remembered.
 This method can be implented in website theme pickers and works for multiple page websites.
